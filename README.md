# Hi, I’m Zachary (a.k.a. houndslight)

I’m a **Software Developer** passionate about building useful, modern applications from scratch.  
My focus is on **full-stack web development**, **media platforms**, and **tools that make life easier**.  
I learn by doing — every project here is something I designed, built, and shipped without the backing of a formal degree.
