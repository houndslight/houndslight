# Hi, I'm Zachary (houndslight) 

A self-taught Software Developer crafting modern full-stack apps that solve real problems—like tracking your dream job or typing faster with friends. No degree, all hustle: I build, ship, and iterate solo. Passionate about web/media tools, Rust for speed, and UIs that just *work*.

Open to full-stack roles in fintech, media, or dev tools. Let's chat: [ocean@outlook.lv](mailto:ocean@outlook.lv) | [Calendly](https://calendly.com/9zach-james/30min) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyjtapocik/)
