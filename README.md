Hi, I’m Zachary (houndslight).

I’m a full-stack software engineer focused on building production-ready systems end to end — from backend architecture and APIs to clean, usable frontends. I care about correctness, performance, and maintainability over shortcuts.

I’ve worked across real-time systems, full CRUD applications, developer tooling, and cross-platform UIs, with an emphasis on writing code that scales and can be owned long-term.

Tech I work with regularly:
- Rust, TypeScript, Python, JavaScript
- React, modern frontend patterns, responsive UI
- Django, REST APIs, authentication
- Real-time and async systems
- Git, CI/CD, Docker

Most of my strongest work is pinned below. Each project is built to demonstrate real engineering decisions, not demos or tutorials.
