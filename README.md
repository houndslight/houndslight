# Hi, I'm Zachary (houndslight) 

A self-taught Software Developer crafting modern full-stack apps that solve real problems—like tracking your dream job or typing faster with friends. No degree, all hustle: I build, ship, and iterate solo. Passionate about web/media tools, Rust for speed, and UIs that just *work*.
